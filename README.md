About Talk
----------

This is a talk intended for users that have not found their own way
into vim usage. The ideal canditate is comfortable with the *nix
environment, but finds vim's barrier of entry too high.

That's perfectly normal. Vim is a difficult beast to ride. But the
benefits of vim are absolutely worth the effort to learn it. This
presentation will prepare the audience with the essentials in
understanding vim as well as the motivation to continue learning it
outside this presentation.
